README:

    Day 1:
        Learned enough Django to set up a backend.
        Set up login page on front end.
        Connected frontend login page to backend.
        Currently, this has login and signup functionality.
        Set up git-based version control.

        Details/explanations:

            The Backend has /admin/, /api/users, /auth/ for user verification.
            The Frontend uses BrowserRouter to switch between display pages.
            These are all using react functional components, and react hooks.
            For a centralized "state", React Context is used to maintain state.

    Day 2:
        Made the api calls to pokeapi
        Added infinite pagination to frontend
        loaded favorites from backend to frontend
        finished login page functionality with forced login

    Day 3:
        Finished Application.
        This includes full functionality for favoriting, displaying metadata, etc.
        All that remains is to host the web application somewhere.
